## [Unreleased]
### Added
- [Criterion benchmark](benches)
- [cstool example](examples/cstool.rs)
- [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/capstone-rust/capstone-rs) code coverage integration
- `PartialOrd`/`Ord` implementation for `InsnId`, `InsnGroupId`, `RegId`
- Lifetime to `Capstone`/`Insn` struct
- Nightly-only feature `alloc_system` to use system allocator instead of the default allocator

### Changed
- Minimum Rust version to 1.23.0
- `Capstone::disasm()` methods take `&mut self` instead of `&self` and returns a new lifetime
- `Capstone` is no longer `Send`/`Sync` (it was mistakenly auto-implemented)
- `Capstone::new()` builder pattern methods take `self` instead of `&mut self`
- `Capstone::set_endian()` is now public (allowed since internal Capstone version was upgraded)

### Removed
- Duplicate/unneeded `Capstone` methods that have equivalents in `InsnDetail`
    - `insn_belongs_to_group()`, `insn_group_ids()`, `register_id_is_read()`, `read_register_ids()`,
      `register_id_is_written()`, `write_register_ids()`

### Changed

- Partition `Mode` enum into: `Mode`, `ExtraMode`, and `Endian`
- Rename `Capstone` methods that return IDs to include `_ids` in name
    - Example: `read_registers()` renamed to `read_register_ids()`
